# TODO List

- Split `tuffixlib.py` into multiple components
  * Exceptions, State, etc
- Eventually merge `TuffixLang` and this Tuffix project in the future?
  - As a component, not a complete replacement. Like an interactive version of this command line tool
- Make this project a stand alone repository so the setup.py can actually install itself


# Given TODO

- [X] status command
- [X] git, atom
- [ ] googletest
- [ ] adding more keywords from older ansible scripts
