# TODO List

- Split `tuffixlib.py` into multiple components
  * Exceptions, State, etc
- Eventually merge `TuffixLang` and this Tuffix project in the future?
  - As a component, not a complete replacement. Like an interactive version of this command line tool
- Make this project a stand alone repository so the setup.py can actually install itself

NOTE: I accidentally truncated the original sources.list, so I am trying to rebuild it.

```
deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu <codename> main multiverse universe restricted
deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu <codename>-security main multiverse universe restricted
```
These seem to be good defaults but a reinstall might need to take place
