# tuffix: Tuffy's Linux

Official Linux environment for CPSC 120, 121, and 131 at California
State University, Fullerton. Our mascot is Tuffy the elephant.

## Overview

The key goal of this effort is to have a unified programming
environment for our introductory courses that is accessible, fosters
collaboration, and enables students and instructors to share working
code with one another.

The major components of Tuffix are

* Ubuntu 20.04
* clang compiler
* GNU g++9 C++ compiler
* Atom text editor
* gdb debugger and Atom's dgb-gdb frontend

Additional tools and libraries are also included to support rich
programming assignments, and courses aside from 120-121-131.
